Fixing dashboard page navigation. Currently module buttons on the left show brief module info on mouse over and open module on click. This needs to be adjusted for touch devices . The suggestion is to open brief module info on  module button touch and have a button in the brief description section on the right to enter the module on touch as well.
  
   Checking all supported exercises on tablet devices (iPad primarily, Geoff can help with testing on Samsung Galaxy tablet as well), Bruce reported  problems with a few exercises and we could reproduce the problems with the 2 exercises reported below: 

   - Scanning exercise 4 gets through you choose on of the options, then it just stops no video continues and there is no button to progress with 
        -  Keep ahead and stay safe- item 1 doesn't work correctly there is a drop down visor but the video never plays
