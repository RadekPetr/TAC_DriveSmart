00:01.000 --> 00:03.320
     <font color="White">The training exercises       
     we're about to perform</font>

00:03.320 --> 00:05.760
       <font color="White">will help improve          
  your ability to concentrate</font>

00:05.760 --> 00:08.040
<font color="White">on more than one thing at a time.</font>

00:08.040 --> 00:12.119
<font color="White">Believe it or not, similar exercises
     have been used in the past</font>

00:12.119 --> 00:15.879
<font color="White">to help develop the concentration 
     span of airline pilots.</font>

00:15.879 --> 00:19.959
 After all, driving and flying    
       <font color="White">are very similar.</font>

00:19.959 --> 00:21.239
         <font color="White">In both cases,</font>

00:21.239 --> 00:24.439
    <font color="White">we need to concentrate        
   on several things at once</font>

00:24.439 --> 00:28.000
  so we need to decide what is    
<font color="White">most important to concentrate on</font>

00:28.000 --> 00:29.520
       <font color="White">at any given time.</font>

00:30.520 --> 00:32.239
  In the following exercises,

00:32.239 --> 00:36.680
<font color="White">you're going to practise performing
    two tasks at the same time.</font>

00:36.680 --> 00:40.360
  The first task is a bit like    
    <font color="White">driving in dense traffic</font>

00:40.360 --> 00:42.360
  at a reasonably high speed.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.760
    <font color="White">You'll have to maintain       
a safe distance between your car</font>

00:45.760 --> 00:47.520
     <font color="White">and the car in front.</font>

00:47.520 --> 00:50.119
       <font color="White">In the other task,         
  you'll have to use your eyes</font>

00:50.119 --> 00:51.520
  and your rear vision mirrors

00:51.520 --> 00:52.800
   <font color="White">to look at lots of numbers</font>

00:52.800 --> 00:56.879
 which will appear in different   
   <font color="White">locations around your car.</font>

00:56.879 --> 00:58.720
<font color="White">It's a bit like when you're driving</font>

00:58.720 --> 01:01.000
      <font color="White">and looking out for         
      potential hazards.</font>

01:01.000 --> 01:04.879
<font color="White">Each time you see a number, you'll
have to make a decision about it.</font>

01:06.400 --> 01:07.959
<font color="White">You're most probably wondering,</font>

01:07.959 --> 01:11.200
 "What has this got to do with    
  <font color="White">driving in the real world?"</font>

01:11.200 --> 01:13.000
  It's pretty simple, really.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.640
<font color="White">When you get through the training,</font>

01:14.640 --> 01:17.320
   <font color="White">you should find it easier      
  to concentrate on everything</font>

01:17.320 --> 01:20.560
   <font color="White">that's going on around you     
        and on the road.</font>

01:20.560 --> 01:23.479
  You'll also find it easier      
  <font color="White">to shift your concentration</font>

01:23.479 --> 01:25.760
   <font color="White">from one thing to another.</font>

01:25.760 --> 01:28.879
 It's important that you follow   
   <font color="White">the instructions carefully</font>

01:28.879 --> 01:30.080
      <font color="White">and whatever you do,</font>

01:30.080 --> 01:33.560
     <font color="White">don't try and complete       
all the training in one session.</font>

01:33.560 --> 01:37.040
   <font color="White">It's much better to spread     
the training over a few sessions.</font>

01:37.040 --> 01:38.680
<font color="White">The instructions will guide you</font>

01:38.680 --> 01:41.160
     <font color="White">on how much training         
  you need to do per session.</font>

01:42.320 --> 01:46.280
<font color="White">Well, that's about all I have to say
to you at the moment, so good luck.</font>

09:47.640 --> 09:49.439
  In the following exercises,

09:49.439 --> 09:53.879
<font color="White">you're going to practise performing

   <font color="White">locations around your car.</font>

10:13.640 --> 10:15.000

10:15.000 --> 10:17.800
      <font color="White">and looking out for
