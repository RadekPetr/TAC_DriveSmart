00:01.000 --> 00:03.320
The training exercises  we're about to perform

00:03.320 --> 00:05.760
will help improve your ability to concentrate

00:05.760 --> 00:08.040
on more than one thing at a time.

00:08.040 --> 00:12.119
Believe it or not, similar exercises have been used in the past

00:12.119 --> 00:15.879
to help develop the concentration  span of airline pilots.

00:15.879 --> 00:19.959
 After all, driving and flying are very similar.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.239
In both cases,

00:21.239 --> 00:24.439
we need to concentrate on several things at once

00:24.439 --> 00:28.000
so we need to decide what is most important to concentrate on

00:28.000 --> 00:29.520
 at any given time.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.239
In the following exercises,

00:32.239 --> 00:36.680
you're going to practise performing two tasks at the same time.

00:36.680 --> 00:40.360
The first task is a bit like driving in dense traffic

00:40.360 --> 00:42.360
at a reasonably high speed.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.760
You'll have to maintain a safe distance between your car

00:45.760 --> 00:47.520
and the car in front.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.119
In the other task, you'll have to use your eyes

00:50.119 --> 00:51.520
and your rear vision mirrors

00:51.520 --> 00:52.800
to look at lots of numbers

00:52.800 --> 00:56.879
which will appear in different locations around your car.

00:56.879 --> 00:58.720
It's a bit like when you're driving

00:58.720 --> 01:01.000
and looking out for potential hazards.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.879
Each time you see a number, you'll have to make a decision about it.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.959
You're most probably wondering,

01:07.959 --> 01:11.200
"What has this got to do with driving in the real world?"

01:11.200 --> 01:13.000
It's pretty simple, really.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.640
When you get through the training,

01:14.640 --> 01:17.320
you should find it easier to concentrate on everything

01:17.320 --> 01:20.560
that's going on around you and on the road.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.479
You'll also find it easier to shift your concentration

01:23.479 --> 01:25.760
from one thing to another.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.879
It's important that you follow the instructions carefully

01:28.879 --> 01:30.080
and whatever you do,

01:30.080 --> 01:33.560
don't try and complete all the training in one session.

01:33.560 --> 01:37.040
It's much better to spread the training over a few sessions.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.680
The instructions will guide you

01:38.680 --> 01:41.160
on how much training you need to do per session.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.280
Well, that's about all I have to say to you at the moment, so good luck.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.439
In the following exercises,

09:49.439 --> 09:53.879
you're going to practise performing two tasks at the same time.

09:53.879 --> 09:57.479
The first task is a bit like driving in dense traffic

09:57.479 --> 09:59.560
at a reasonably high speed.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.959
You'll have to maintain a safe distance between your car

10:02.959 --> 10:04.720
and the car in front.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.320
In the other task, you'll have to use your eyes

10:07.320 --> 10:08.680
and your rear vision mirrors

10:08.680 --> 10:09.879
to look at lots of numbers

10:09.879 --> 10:13.640
which will appear in different locations around your car.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.000
It's a bit like you're driving

10:15.000 --> 10:17.800
and looking out for potential hazards.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.640
Each time you see a number, you'll have to make a decision about it.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.760
You're most probably wondering

10:24.760 --> 10:27.920
what this has to do with driving in the real world.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.920
It's pretty simple, really.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.200
When you get through the training,

10:31.200 --> 10:33.920
you should find it easier to concentrate on everything

10:33.920 --> 10:36.800
that's going on around you out on the road.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.360
You'll also find it easier

10:38.360 --> 10:41.800
to shift your concentration from one thing to another.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.680
It's important that you follow the instructions carefully

11:31.680 --> 11:33.000
and whatever you do,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.400
don't try and complete all the training in one session.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.720
It's much better to spread the training over a few sessions.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.239
The instructions will guide you

11:41.239 --> 11:44.239
on how much training you need to do per session.

11:44.239 --> 11:47.879
Well, that's about all I have to say to you at the moment, so good luck.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.360
 The training exercises we're about to perform

12:03.360 --> 12:05.000
will help you improve your ability

12:05.000 --> 12:08.400
to concentrate on more than one thing at a time.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.520
Believe it or not, similar exercises have been used in the past

12:12.520 --> 12:16.040
to develop the concentration span of airline pilots.

12:16.040 --> 12:20.200
After all, driving and flying are very similar.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.800
In both cases,

13:03.800 --> 13:06.959
we need to concentrate on several things at once,

13:06.959 --> 13:08.400
so we need to decide

13:08.400 --> 13:12.280
what is most important to concentrate on at any given time.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.119
You're most probably wondering

13:51.119 --> 13:54.439
what this has to do with driving in the real world.

13:54.439 --> 13:56.479
It's pretty simple, really.

13:56.479 --> 13:57.959
When you get through the training,

13:57.959 --> 14:00.439
you should find it easier to concentrate on everything

14:00.439 --> 14:03.640
that's going on around you out on the road.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.080
You'll find it easier to shift your concentration

14:06.080 --> 14:08.200
from one thing to another.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.080
In the following exercises,

14:24.080 --> 14:28.640
you're going to practise performing two tasks at the same time.
