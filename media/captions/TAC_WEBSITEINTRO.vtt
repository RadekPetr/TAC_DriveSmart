Welcome to Drive Smart.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.760
This short introduction provides you with some key tips

00:04.760 --> 00:06.280
before you get started.

00:06.280 --> 00:07.840
This is the Dashboard.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.560
At first, only the introduction is available,

00:10.560 --> 00:12.479
but after completing the introduction,

00:12.479 --> 00:14.959
the Scanning, Keep Ahead and Play Safe

00:14.959 --> 00:16.360
and Concentration modules

00:16.360 --> 00:17.520
will become available.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.040
Once you've completed the first three modules,

00:20.040 --> 00:22.520
the Country Driving and Urban Driving modules

00:22.520 --> 00:24.879
will become available for you to work through.

00:24.879 --> 00:27.920
At any time during your progress through Drive Smart,

00:27.920 --> 00:31.080
you can return to this Dashboard to check your progress

00:31.080 --> 00:33.760
and select any module available to you.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.200
The links highlighted at the top of the page

00:36.200 --> 00:39.200
are generally available from Drive Smart pages.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.920
Clicking on the Drive Smart logo takes you back to the login page.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.600
Clicking the Dashboard brings you back to this page.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.040
Clicking 'Hall of Fame'

00:48.040 --> 00:51.160
shows you how you and other people have performed

00:51.160 --> 00:53.320
on Drive Smart exercises.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.640
Clicking on 'Help' takes you to more information on Drive Smart

00:56.640 --> 00:57.800
and how to use it.

00:57.800 --> 01:02.479
Clicking 'Feedback' lets you send a message to the Drive Smart team.

01:02.479 --> 01:06.040
And finally, clicking 'Log Out' exits you from Drive Smart.
