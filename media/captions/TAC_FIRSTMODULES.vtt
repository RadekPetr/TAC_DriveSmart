00:01.000 --> 00:04.119
In this section, we'll introduce you to some important skills

00:04.119 --> 00:06.200
that'll help you survive on the road.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.800
There are two things that you'll have to think about and practise.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.959
The first one is SKAPS.

00:12.959 --> 00:14.160
SKAPS stands for:

00:17.160 --> 00:18.479
But we'll go into this

00:18.479 --> 00:19.800
in more detail later.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.959
The second thing is concentration.

00:22.959 --> 00:25.760
We all know what concentration means but when we're driving

00:25.760 --> 00:29.000
we need to concentrate on several things at once.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.400
In some instances,

00:30.400 --> 00:32.320
you'll need to know what to concentrate on

00:32.320 --> 00:34.760
in a dangerous situation.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.239
So these are the two things you'll need to keep in mind

00:37.239 --> 00:38.920
for safe driving.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.760
But don't worry - you'll have heaps of opportunity to practise them

00:41.760 --> 00:43.520
as we go through the program.
