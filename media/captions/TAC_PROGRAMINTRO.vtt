00:01.000 --> 00:04.119
Drive Smart was created specifically for new drivers.

00:04.119 --> 00:07.080
Completing Drive Smart will give you a better understanding

00:07.080 --> 00:08.879
of different driving situations

00:08.879 --> 00:11.840
so you'll know what to do when you come across them on the road.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.920
 You'll have the opportunityto identify safe responses

00:14.920 --> 00:17.479
to some dangerous driving situations.

00:17.479 --> 00:19.080
     Don't be discouraged

00:19.080 --> 00:22.400
 if you don't respond correctlyto every situation.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.720
We're showing you what can happen in real life

00:24.720 --> 00:26.720
and some situations would be difficult

00:26.720 --> 00:30.040
for even the most experienced driver to handle.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.160
The most important thing is to learn from your mistakes

00:33.160 --> 00:37.680
so that you can go out onto the road a better, safer driver.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.239
Drive Smart will show you the types of things you can expect to happen

00:41.239 --> 00:43.239
 when you are behind the wheelof a car.

00:43.239 --> 00:46.239
You'll see what happens when you drive too fast,

00:46.239 --> 00:49.239
take risks or forget to concentrate.

00:49.239 --> 00:50.879
  And just like in real life,

00:50.879 --> 00:54.720
you'll also have to deal with other people's mistakes and bad driving.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.560
We think you'll find the program both interesting and informative.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.239
You'll be watching and commenting

01:01.239 --> 01:04.520
on many different video sequences from around town,

01:04.520 --> 01:07.680
on the freeway and in rural areas.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.680
You'll have to make some quick decisions

01:09.680 --> 01:12.040
 which will test such thingsas your memory

01:12.040 --> 01:15.680
 and your ability to predictwhat other drivers will do next.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.360
We all know that road accidents kill and injure

01:18.360 --> 01:20.400
 far too many people each year.

01:20.400 --> 01:24.879
 The skills that you develop fromthis program could save your life.
