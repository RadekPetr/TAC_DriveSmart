00:01.000 --> 00:02.280
The 'KA' in SKAPS

00:02.280 --> 00:04.360
stands for 'keeping ahead'.

00:04.360 --> 00:07.959
Keeping ahead is another skill we need for safe driving.

00:07.959 --> 00:10.640
This means looking far beyond our own car

00:10.640 --> 00:13.080
to see potential hazards on the road.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.400
This will help us avoid risks or at least reduce them.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.119
We can't afford to take risks when driving

00:19.119 --> 00:21.080
because the stakes are too high.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.720
It may mean that we slow down as we approach traffic lights

00:24.720 --> 00:29.239
or stay behind a slow driver until it's safe to overtake.

00:29.239 --> 00:31.040
The 'PS' in SKAPS

00:31.040 --> 00:33.119
stands for 'playing it safe'.

00:33.119 --> 00:36.680
Playing it safe means avoiding risks wherever possible

00:36.680 --> 00:38.760
by always choosing the safer option.
