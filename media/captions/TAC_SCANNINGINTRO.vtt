00:01.000 --> 00:02.520
The 'S' in SKAPS

00:02.520 --> 00:04.680
stands for 'scanning'.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.840
Scanning means always looking around for other things

00:07.840 --> 00:12.360
such as cars, cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.640
We must maintain a constant scan of the whole driving scene

00:16.640 --> 00:18.920
and keep checking our mirrors.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.640
After all, if we're scanningfor too long in one direction,

00:21.640 --> 00:24.119
we might not see another hazard until it's too late.
